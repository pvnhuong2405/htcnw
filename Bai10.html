        <p>While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will 
            instead focus on giving you the practical skills to build your first site.

            The aim is to show you to create your first web page without spending the entire tutorial focusing too much 
            on the “why.”
            
            By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website and we hope that this will inspire 
            you to delve further into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.

        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. 
        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published 
        in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used 
        but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.</p>
